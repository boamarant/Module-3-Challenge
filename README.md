# Module-3-Challenge

## Description

This project was completed for the Columbia Coding Bootcamp. The purpose of this project was to add functionality to a page using JavaScript that allows the user to input the first and last name of employees, as well as their salaries, to a table. The code allows the user to continue adding employees until they are satisfied, and then outputs the average salary of the employees in the console, as well as chooses a random employee as a raffle winner.

## Credits

I referenced previous projects and examples from the Columbia University Coding Bootcamp to assist in creating this page. ChatGPT helped me work through bugs that I was having. 

## Features

The "Add Employee" button will allow the user to input the first name, last name, and salary of as many employees as they want as long as they choose to continue. The console will display their average salary and choose a random employee as a raffle winner at the end.
